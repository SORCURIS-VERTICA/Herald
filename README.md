# Herald
Herald is a work in progress; the goal is to make everything 2D interactive, using basic web development.

Version 0.1
1. A proper 640x640 static canvas with a smooth transitioning image and map drawing is implemented as a standard graphical map for the player to move around.
2. Herald is able to move at all directions, rectangular collisions are made to restrict the object from passing through a 2d array map that has an index content of 1, being 0 as a walkable path.
3. Objects/Items in map are accesible by pressing the space-bar on collision with an objec.
4. NPC's are present and can add more, with immutable static messages (will be changed soon)
